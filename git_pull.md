## Git Pull

##### Definition -

- This is a command that we use to update the local repo so that it gets inline with master branch. This is really important as you don't want to invert some new changes that were made during the time you worked on the project.

##### Code -

    git pull


Usually if the access to repository is restricted, then git will ask for the passphrase.
