## Git Clone

##### Definition -

- This is a command that we use to create a copy of the project on which we can add changes and test them out without disturbing current working version of the software.


##### Code -

    git clone <repo_name>


Usually if the access to repository is restricted, then git will ask for the passphrase.

In case of github, in macos we can install 'gh' using homebrew to directly clone github repo into our local system using terminal.
